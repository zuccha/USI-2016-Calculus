# USI-Calculus-Spring-2016

This is a collection of notes taken from the calculus course given by Prof. Michael Bronstein at USI. Students are free to download the notes and contribute to add content and correct mistakes.

The notes have been written in LaTeX. A pdf can be generated by compiling `notes.tex`.

PDF files can be downloaded [here](http://atelier.inf.unisi.ch/~zuccha/en/content/usi.html).


## notes_converter

`notes.cpp` is a program written in c++ that generates more concise notes from `notes.tex`.

To run the program, execute from terminal `./notes_converter notes.tex`.

The program will generate three new files:
- `notes_definitions.tex`: notes with definitions and theorems, without proofs and examples.
- `notes_proofs.tex`: notes with definitions, theorems and their proofs. No examples.
- `notes_examples.tex`: notes with definitions, theorems and examples. No proofs.

### Editing calculus_notes.tex

To increase code readability, instead of writing long mathematical code, write `\newcommand`s and use those already defined. `\newcommand`s should be defined on top of the .tex document. To write definitions, theorems, remarks, proof, ... it is better to use the provided environments (e.g. `\begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem}`.
