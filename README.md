# USI-Calculus-Spring-2016

This is a collection of notes taken from the calculus course given by Prof. Michael Bronstein at USI. Students are free to download the content and contribute to add content and correct mistakes.

The notes have been written in LaTeX. Weird tabulations in the source file may be caused by Atom, the editor with which the document has been made.

Depending on a document, it may be have more or less content:
- **Calculus notes complete**: notes with definitions, theorems, proofs and examples.
- **Calculus notes definitions**: notes with definitions and theorems, without proofs and examples.
- **Calculus notes proofs**: notes with definitions, theorems and their proof. No examples.
